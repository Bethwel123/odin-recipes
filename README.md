# Odin Recipes

This is my first project for The Odin Project curriculum. Itâ€™s a basic HTML website that displays a collection of recipes.

## Goals and Skills Demonstrated

- Understanding the basic structure of HTML documents
- Using elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images
- Organizing content with semantic HTML
- Working with Git for version control
- Using GitHub to host and share code

This project will serve as a foundation for future improvements with CSS and JavaScript.
